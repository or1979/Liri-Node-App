# Liri-Node-App

Requirements
The challenge was to use Node JS to create a LIRI bot, like iPhone's SIRI, but takes in command through Language vs Speech. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data based on one of four commands:


spotify-this-song

movie-this

concert-this

do-what-it-says

What the Commands do
spotify-this-song:
Displays the artist, song's name, album, and a preview of the song the user types after the command.

movie-this:
Displays the movie title, year, actors, plot, country, ratings(IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes) and language of the movie the user types in after the command.

do-what-it-says
Runs the song written on the random.text file through the spotify-this-song function.

What I Used
Node.js
Spotify NPM Package
Axios NPM Package
BandsInTown API
OMDB API
